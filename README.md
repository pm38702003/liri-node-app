# liri-node-app
LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Following commands are supported:
node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>
node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>
node liri.js do-what-it-says (LIRI will take text from inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.  For example make a file called `random.txt`. Inside of `random.txt` put the following in with no extra characters or white space: spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way")
